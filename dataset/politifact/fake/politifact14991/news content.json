Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Newborn-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/cortez-yell-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-657657560-200x150.png", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Getty-Images12-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Biden-Iraq-War-Resolution-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/GettyImages-1150805025-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/sanders-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1161845877-e1567772268315-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Ayotzinapa-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Biden-Eye-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1166106094-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1125792102-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Ocasio-Cortez-200x150.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/Donald-Trump-carbon-emissions-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/US-POLITICS-ELECTIONS-TRUMP-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/byers-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/AP-Photo-Ted-S.-Warren-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/LAPD-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/tylerperry1-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/dana-nessel-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/afp/03/66dcdc_us-president-donald-trump-fed-chief-jerome-powell-white-house-in-2017-has-e1567797343818-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Hands-On-Biden-200x150.png"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rep.
