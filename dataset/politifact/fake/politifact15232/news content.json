This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.\n\nAs the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.\n\nWitness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a gun on me but wish I did\u201d pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa \u2014 \u13e2\u13d2\u13a5s\u13df\u13a5\u13de\u13de\u13aa\u2019s \u13c9\u13a5\u13ac\u13b3 (@passionchica) April 3, 2018\n\n\u201cWhen asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, \u201cI knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.\u201d\n\nThe witness also added, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.\u201d\n\nHe said he wished he had a gun. And that\u2019s the way he should feel. And that\u2019s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn\u2019t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. \u2018\n\nWow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! \u2014 al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018\n\nReports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.\n\nCalifornia is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50\u2019s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.\n\nI am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms\u2026 they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that\u2019s all.\n\nThe shooter has now been identified via ABC 30\n\nSAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.\n\nAghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.\n\nSources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.\n\nAccording to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.\n\nPolice and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.\n\nShe embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube \u201cAd-apocalypse\u201d where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.\n\nNeistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.\n\nIt appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, \u201cBe aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term profits and do anything to reach their goals even by fooling simple-minded people, hiding the truth, manipulating science and everything, putting public mental and physical health at risk, abusing non-human animals, polluting the environment, destroying family values, promoting materialism and sexual degeneration in the name of freedom and turning people into programmed robots!\u201d\n\nShe goes on to quote Adolf Hitler saying, \u201cMake the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it and eventually they will believe it.\u201d\n\nThe rest of her message targets YouTube and censorship. \u201cThere is no free speech in the real world and you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system. Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated so that people can hardly see their videos.\u201d\n\nFebruary 20, YouTube enacted a new advertising policy that demonetized channels with less than 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time. Though Aghdam\u2019s main English channel had more than 15,000 subscribers, many of her videos appeared to be demonetized.", "images":
